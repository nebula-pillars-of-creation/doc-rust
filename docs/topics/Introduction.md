5. **Ask for Help**: If you get stuck, donâ€™t hesitate to seek help. Join Rust communities, ask questions, and
   collaborate with others. Coding is a team sport!

> Take regular breaks while coding. Taking a short break every hour can significantly improve your focus and quality of
> your code.
> Donâ€™t rush through the levels. Each level is designed to give you a deeper understanding of Rust. Try to fully
> understand the content before moving on to the next level.

> Experiment with the code. Donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes. Thatâ€™s part of the learning process.

```text
fn greet_world(name: &str) {
    // Print a hello world message
    println!("Hello, {} World!", name);
}

fn main() {
    // Call the greet_world function with 'Rust' as argument
    greet_world("Rust");
}
```

Output

```text
Hello, Rust World!
```

We believe that learning should be fun, engaging, and rewarding. So, keep your curiosity alive, experiment boldly, and
